About
-----
This is the source of the "CSA Mandelzoom" tool, created by Computer System Architects (CSA) around 1989.

It maps an existing Transputer network and loads workers onto every T4xx/T8xx found. Integer as well as floatingpoint workers are provided. Graphical output is either CGS, EGA or VGA currently at 16 colors max.

Prerequisites
-------------
* At least one Transputer (does not make sense without one)
* A x86 PC running [MS|Free|Open|PC]DOS - yes, it's DOS only
* Borland C-compiler (I use BC++ 2.0)
* LSC Transputer cross C-Compiler (use this [link to download](http://www.classiccmp.org/transputer/software/languages/ansic/lsc/lsc-V89.1.tar.gz)

Enhancements
------------
I've added some functions as well as a high-precision timer, mainly used for benchmarking.

But still there are many things to do:
* Better graphics support (higher resoluton, more colors)
* Better Transputer detection (crashed if T2xx or C004 are found)
* Better Timer-Lib. This current is an eval version, manufacturer vanished, can't remove nag-screen.
* Enhance link adaptor support (currently B004 interface only)
* Mouse control?
* ...

In doubt enter "man /?" for options.
