This is the source of the "CSA Mandelzoom" tool, created by Computer System Architects (CSA) around 1989.

It maps an existing Transputer network and loads workers onto every T4xx/T8xx found. Integer as well as floatingpoint workers are provided.
I've added some functions as well as a high-precision timer, mainly used for benchmarking.

Several benchmarking results can be found here: http://www.geekdot.com/lies-damn-lies-and-benchmarks/
